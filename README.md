</details>

<br/>

This list was inspired by (and draws from) the [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/) project and
the [Ideas That Created the Future](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future) book by Harry R. Lewis.
I also found [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) blog to be an extremely useful resource.
For distributed systems, I used [Distributed systems for fun and profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/index.html)
and for Relational Data Bases, I used the [Red Book](http://www.redbook.io/).

## Meta reads

A few interesting resources about reading papers from Papers We Love and elsewhere:

- [Should I read papers?](https://michaelrbernste.in/2014/10/21/should-i-read-papers.html)
- [How to Read an Academic Article](https://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/08/31/how-to-read-an-academic-article/)
- How to Read a Paper. [Keshav (2007)](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).
- Efficient Reading of Papers in Science and Technology. [Hanson (1999)](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/netbib/efficientReading.pdf).
- On ICSE’s “Most Influential Papers”. [Parnas (1995)](http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~yaoguo/PhDReading07/parnas-review.pdf).

## Selection criteria

1. The list should stay short. Let's say no more than 30 papers.
   - The idea is not to include every interesting paper that I come across but rather to keep a representative list that's possible to read from start to finish with a similar level of effort as reading a technical book from cover to cover.
   - I tried to include one paper per each major topic and author. Since in the process I found a lot of noteworthy alternatives, related or follow-up papers and I wanted to keep track of those as well, I included them as sublist items (some of these sublists are currently longer than they should).
2. The papers shouldn't be too long. For the same reasons as the previous item, I try to avoid papers longer than 20 or 30 pages.
3. They should be self-contained and readable enough to be approachable by the casual technical reader.
4. They should be freely available online.
5. Although historical relevance was taken into account, I omitted seminal papers in the cases where I found them hard to approach, when the main subject of the paper wasn't the thing that made them influential, etc.
   - That being said, where possible I preferred the original paper on each subject over modern updates or summary papers.
6. I tended to prefer topics that I can relate to my professional practice, typically papers originated in the industry
or about innovations that later saw wide adoption.
   - Similarly, I tended to skip more theoretical papers, those focusing on mathematical foundations for Computer Science, electronic aspects of hardware, etc.
   - UI/UX and modern Machine Learning are missing because I'm not familiar enough with those areas to find relevant, non overly specific papers. Suggestions are welcome.
   
Disclaimer: I'm not a frequent paper reader, so I made this list as a sort of roadmap for myself. I haven't read all of the papers in the list yet; as I do, I may find than some don't meet the described criteria after all and remove them, or decide to add new ones.

And, yes, this repository is a way to procrastinate on the actual reading after I finished making the list.
