## Selection criteria

1. The list should stay short. Let's say no more than 30 papers.
   - The idea is not to include every interesting paper that I come across but rather to keep a representative list that's possible to read from start to finish with a similar level of effort as reading a technical book from cover to cover.
   - I tried to include one paper per each major topic and author. Since in the process I found a lot of noteworthy alternatives, related or follow-up papers and I wanted to keep track of those as well, I included them as sublist items.
2. The papers shouldn't be too long. For the same reasons as the previous item, I try to avoid papers longer than 20 or 30 pages.
3. They should be self-contained and readable enough to be approachable by the casual technical reader.
4. They should be freely available online.
5. Although historical relevance was taken into account, I omitted seminal papers in the cases where I found them hard to approach, when the main subject of the paper wasn't the thing that made them influential, etc.
   - Examples of this are classic works by Von Neumann, Turing and Shannon.
   - That being said, where possible I preferred the original paper on each subject over modern updates or survey papers.
6. I tended to prefer topics that I can relate to my professional practice, typically papers originated in the industry
or about innovations that later saw wide adoption.
   - Similarly, I tended to skip more theoretical papers, those focusing on mathematical foundations for Computer Science, electronic aspects of hardware, etc.
   - Machine Learning is mostly missing because I'm not familiar enough with the area to find relevant, non overly specific papers. Suggestions are welcome.
7. I sorted the list by a mix of relatedness of topics and a vague chronological relevance, such that it makes sense to read it in the suggested order. For example, historical and seminal topics go first, contemporary internet-era developments last, networking precedes distributed systems, etc.
