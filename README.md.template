This list was inspired by (and draws from) the [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/) project and
the [Ideas That Created the Future](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future) book by Harry R. Lewis.
I also found [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) blog to be an extremly useful resource.

## Selection criteria

1. The list should stay short. Let's say no more than 30 papers.
   - The idea is not to include every interesting paper that I come across but rather to keep a representative list that's possible to read from start to finish with a similar level of effort as reading a technical book from cover to cover.
   - I tried to include one paper per each major topic and author. Since in the process I found a lot of noteworthy alternative, related or follow-up papers and I wanted to keep track of those as well, included them as sublist items (some of these sublists are currently longer than they should).
2. The papers shouldn't be too long. For the same reasons as the previous item, I try to avoid papers longer than 20 or 30 pages.
3. They should be self-contained and readable enough to be approachable by the casual technical reader.
4. They should be freely available online.
5. Although historical relevance was taken into account, I omitted seminal papers in the cases where I found them hard to approach, when the main subject of the paper wasn't the thing that made them influential, etc.
   - That being said, where possible I preferred the original paper on each subject over modern updates or summary papers.
6. I tended to prefer topics that I can relate to my professional practice, typically papers originated in the industry
or about innovations that later saw wide adoption. Likewise I tended to skip more theoretical papers, those focused on mathematical foundations for Computer Science, on electronic aspects of hardware, etc.


Disclaimer: I'm not a frequent paper reader, so I made this list as a sort of roadmap for myself. I haven't read all of the papers in the list yet; as I do, I may find than some don't meet the described criteria after all and remove them, or decide to add new ones.

And, yes, this repository is a way to procrastinate on the actual reading after I finished making the list.
